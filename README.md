# Sea-Of-Madness
##  My plan is to create a text based adventure game with Lovecraftian horror themes. This game will be similar to the many text based choose your path adventure games that were very common in the early 70s and 80s. Some examples of these games are “The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy” and “Zork”. I want to aim high for this project, and see what I can do, so the game won’t consist of just branching choices. I plan on incorporating a few different status effects for the player, which will highly influence the outcome of different interactions.
